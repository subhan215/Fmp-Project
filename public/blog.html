            <h2>Features that now a days cameras should have</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <div class="textp">
                    <h4>1.Voice Memos</h4>
                    <p>Practically every camera these days has a microphone and a
                        storage device. So why has it taken so long for voice memos
                        to find their way to the masses? <br> <br>
                        High-end professional cameras have had voice
                        memo options for ages. A quick Google search
                        tells me it existed on the Canon EOS-1D Mark II
                        in 2007 and the Nikon D2X in 2004, and maybe
                        even on some earlier cameras. <br><br>
                        Voice memos aren't something everyone would use, but for
                        documentary photographers, wedding photographers,
                        and a few others, they can be a big help. <br><br>
                        I'm glad to see Nikon adding voice memos to some of their less expensive cameras via a 
                        firmware
                        update, including the Nikon Z6 that was released a few years ago. Hopefully more camera
                        companies
                        follow suit.</p>

                    <h4 >2.GPS</h4>
                    <p>
                        A lot of cameras are compatible with external GPS units that can tag your photos as you
                        take
                        them,
                        but there's no reason for the extra expense and annoyance of a dongle. To me,  the proof is
                        in
                        point-and-shoot cameras. So many of them have built-in GPS, even  cameras from more than a
                        decade
                        ago. If companies could add it to such basic cameras for so long, why isn't everyone adding
                        it
                        to
                        higher-end cameras today? (Maybe this next  part is asking too much, but I'd also like to
                        see
                        the GPS
                        sync your current location with the  camera's clock, so you don't need to change the time in
                        the
                        menu
                        each time you go to a  different time zone.) <br><br>

                        At least GPS is found on more cameras than some of the other features on this list. But it 
                        should be
                        as common as WiFi and bluetooth - and it shouldn't require you to sync your camera to your 
                        smartphone in order to piggyback on the phone's GPS.

                    <h4>3.Sensor Shift High Resolution</h4>
                    <p>One feature that's gotten a lot of attention recently, and is found in increasingly more 
                        cameras, is
                        a pixel-shift high resolution mode on cameras with in-body image stabilization.  This mode
                        takes
                        multiple photos in a row with slightly different sensor positions, then  merges them
                        together to
                        increase resolution substantially. On most cameras with pixel-shift,  you can quadruple the
                        sensor's
                        native resolution.</p>

                    <h4>4.Multi-Axis Tilting Camera Screen</h4>
                    <p>As a landscape photographer, I've found tilting camera screens to be a huge ergonomic 
                        improvement in
                        recent cameras. And while almost every camera these days has at least a single-axis tilt,
                        not
                        enough
                        of them can tilt sideways. For vertical photography, this sideways tilt is a big help. I'd
                        like
                        to
                        see multi-axis tilting screens (or fully articulating  screens) find their way to more
                        cameras
                        in the
                        future. Although a lot more cameras have it  these days, a few companies still lack it in
                        some
                        of
                        their most important cameras (like the Nikon Z7 II and Sony A7R IV).</p>

                    <h4>5.Animal-Eye-AF</h4>
                    <p>Most new cameras have eye-AF capabilities that can track the eye of the person you're 
                        photographing. Animal-eye-AF, though, is rarer. <br><br>
                        I admit that this feature may not be necessary once you master the standard tracking 
                        capabilities of your camera, but it's still something I'd like to see more often. Not all 
                        photographers are pros who have hundreds of hours to spend learning their camera's tracking
                        capabilities inside and out, so a bit of a head start like this can be nice.

                    <h4>6.Sensor Dust Protector Curtain</h4>
                    <p>I've found when shooting mirrorless that my sensor gets dirty more often compared to using a
                        DSLR.
                        It's not a big pain to clean it, but I'd rather worry about other things when I'm out in
                        the
                        field. <br><br>
                        I'm sure someone will correct me on this, but as far as I know, the first camera with a
                        dust- protection curtain was the Canon EOS R. When you remove the lens on the EOS R, the
                        
                        shutter
                        curtain closes in order to protect the sensor from the outside world, including  dust.
                        <br><br>
                        Other cameras have added this feature in the meantime, including the Nikon Z9 (which 
                        doesn't
                        even
                        have a mechanical shutter and instead uses a dedicated dust protection  curtain for the
                        job). I
                        hope
                        it becomes standard issue on all mirrorless cameras, and frankly, even on DSLRs.

                    <h4>7.Illuminated Buttons</h4>
                    <p>
                        I'll be the first to say that you should learn how to use your camera with your eyes closed.
                         You should instinctively know the location of every button and dial, or you'll miss
                        some
                        
                        shots in fast-moving conditions. However, for Milky Way photography or other shoots in 
                        pitch-black environments, backlit illuminated buttons can still be very useful. It certainly
                        
                        beats a bright headlamp that can shine into your photo or just ruin your night vision. <br>
                        <br>
                        A few cameras have illuminated buttons, and the Pentax K-1 series even has a small light
                        
                        that
                        illuminates the camera lens mount! For changing lenses at night, this makes things a 
                        lot
                        easier.
                        I'd like to see both these features on landscape-oriented cameras in the future.

                <p>
                    Some cameras show a live preview of how your exposure is building up during a Bulb or 
                    Time
                    exposure. This is a helpful way to tell when to end an ultra-long exposure rather than 
                    spending
                    lots of time with trial and error. This is a big win for Olympus including such a 
                    feature
                    when
                    most camera companies don't!

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                One thing that impressed me while working on this article is that the unique features I've 
                listed
                here are spread out among camera brands pretty evenly (although Olympus gets the nod for
                having
                the
                most). To me, this shows that every camera company has something good to offer and they can
                still
                learn from one another when making new cameras. Now it's just time to put that into
                practice!
                Let's
                see a camera that has all these features and more. I'm sure there are many possible
                features
                that I
                can't even begin to guess, which aren't on any camera today.
                <br><br>
                Are there any that I missed, or some feature you're especially hoping reaches your next 
                camera?
                For
                my landscape photography, I'd personally love to see a camera with raw histograms and
                vibration
                detection when firing the shutter, unlikely though it may be. But  I'd frankly be excited if
                any
                of
                these features become more widespread. After all, as I said  at the start of the article,
                the
                technology is already here -all we need is for today's camera companies to bring it all
                together.
